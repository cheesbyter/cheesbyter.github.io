# Hello und Hallo
## What i'm Doing
I'm in study for the VET Diploma in Informatik at the WISS in St. Gallen. For that reason im creating here the repository IFZ-626. 
This would be my course repo for my work during the training. Also i will try to create my Journals, which i have to write for every
modul, with markdown. I'm not so sure that i can do it. Because we have to provide it with certain formating, which is not as easy as i thought. 

## My First Module on here would be m355 Mobile Applicationen erstellen.
